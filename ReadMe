   Synthesized Distance Matrix
/------------------------------
The distance matrices used by sequential and parallel FNJ are triangular matrices, generated by scrpi python geraTriangular.py - in the directory called matrix.

/---------------------------
   Sequential Version
/---------------------------
The sequential version, fnj_3.c, receives as input the name of the file that contains the distance matrix, and the integers p and q, whose p/q must be less than or equal to 0.5.

./fnj distancematrix.inc 1 2

/---------------------------
   Parallel Versions
/---------------------------
Parallel versions receive as input the name of the file containing the distance matrix and a real number representing the fraction p/q, which must be less than or equal to 0.5.

./parFnj_v2 distancematrix.inc 0.5

/---------------------------
   Robinsin-Foulds metric
/---------------------------
The output of the programs is the time and the phylogenetic tree in Newick format, which is inserted into the python scrpit RF_lenght.py to compare with the other algorithms - in the directory called RF_script.

/---------------------------
   Compiling
/---------------------------
gcc -o fnj -lm fnj_3.c
gcc -o parFNJ_v1 -lm -openmp parFNJ_v1.c
gcc -o parFNJ_v2 -lm -openmp parFNJ_v2.c
